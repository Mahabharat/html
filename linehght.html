<h1><b>What is new in version 4.0 </b>(2015-11-15)</h1>
<p>
Pasting now happens when you press your hot-key instead of releasing it. You can also press-and-hold your hot-key to perform multiple pastes.
Added hot-key information to PureText's option dialog, which provides details about known hot-keys and possible conflicts when picking a specific hot-key.
Fixed issue where PureText would sometimes stop working after pressing Win+L or Ctrl+Alt+Delete.
More hot-key combinations are supported and a few problematic hot-keys have been blocked.
PureText will now warn you if you are running PureText.exe from a temporary folder or if PureText.exe is marked as 'blocked'. These can happen when PureText.exe is ran directly from the zip file that is downloaded from the internet.
PureText.exe is now digitally signed with my publisher certificate, which makes Windows and some virus protection programs happier.
Fixed some pasting issues with Firefox and Thunderbird on Windows XP.
Added /N startup option to start with no icon.
Added /U startup option to uninstall registry entries.

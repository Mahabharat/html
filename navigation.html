<p><b>What is new in version 4.0 </b>(2015-11-15)</p>
<ul style="line-height:1.3">
<li>Pasting now happens when you press your hot-key instead of releasing it. You can also press-and-hold your hot-key to perform multiple pastes.</li>
<li>Added hot-key information to PureText's option dialog, which provides details about known hot-keys and possible conflicts when picking a specific hot-key.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where PureText would sometimes stop working after pressing Win+L or Ctrl+Alt+Delete.</li>
<li>More hot-key combinations are supported and a few problematic hot-keys have been blocked.</li>
<li>PureText will now warn you if you are running PureText.exe from a temporary folder or if PureText.exe is marked as 'blocked'. These can happen when PureText.exe is ran directly from the zip file that is downloaded from the internet.</li>
<li>PureText.exe is now digitally signed with my publisher certificate, which makes Windows and some virus protection programs happier.</li>
<li>Fixed some pasting issues with Firefox and Thunderbird on Windows XP.</li>
<li>Added /N startup option to start with no icon.</li>
<li>Added /U startup option to uninstall registry entries.</li>
</ul>

<ul style="line-height:1.3">
<li>Fixed issue that prevented many Hot-Keys from working on Windows 8. You can once again use WINDOWS+V and many other Hot-Key combinations.</li>
<li>Fixed pasting issue with Firefox 17, Thunderbird 17, and other Mozilla products.</li>
<li>Added support for using the ALT key in Hot-Keys.</li>
<li>Adding a Windows 64-bit version of PureText for the first time.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>What was new in version 2.0 </b>(2003-08-21)</p>
<ul style="line-height:1.3">

<li>Added an option to play a sound when the Hot-Key is pressed.</li>
<li>Added option to have PureText start each time you log on to Windows.</li>
<li>Updated dialogs to use new XP look when running on XP and beyond.</li>
<li>Added command line options to allow PureText to convert the clipboard contents to pure text, optionally perform a paste and play a sound, and then immediately exit. Run &quot;PureText.exe /?&quot; for command line help.</li>
<li>Changed the default Hot-Key to WINDOWS+V.</li>
<li>Removed the ability to create Hot-Keys that include the ALT key, as the ALT key prevents the Paste feature from working.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with the Hot-Key capture dialog.</li>
<li>Blocked all Hot-Keys that contain CTRL+V, as they cause problems with the Paste feature.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that only allowed up to 30,000 characters to be converted.</li>
